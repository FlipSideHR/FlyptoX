The Order Matcher's role is to process a valid order from the
order desk and try to partially or completely fill it against other
orders resting on the order book.

The matcher listens for a 'new:order' event emitted by the order desk
that passes it an order-id

Assumptions:
- The order desk has already saved the order to the database
- Holds are already placed on the appropriate currency account

Processing:

fetch the "order" from the database (model)

fetch "counter offers" from db (collection)
    If order side is a 'buy', load the asks where price <= order.price  and status = 'open'
    If order side is a 'sell', load the bids where price >= order.price and status = 'open'
      sorted by best price (descending for asks, ascending for bids)
      sorted by 'created_at' ascending (oldest orders get matched first)

Incoming order is considered the taker_order
  because they would removed an order from the market if there is a match

loop over offers in counter offers collection

  order remaining size = order.size - order.filled_size (A)
  offer remaining size = offer.size - offer.filled_size (B)

  >> assert order remaining  size > 0

  if order and offer remaining sizes match (A == B)
     BEGIN transaction (SQL)
     do complete fill to order
       set order status to 'done'
       set order done_reason to 'match'
       set order filled_size to order.size

Handling Market Orders
----------------------------------------------------
http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketorder.asp

We can look ahead and add up the volumes of all counter offers to determine
which case we will result in (complete or partial fill)

Generally risky to do market orders on low volume exchanges..

case 1: enough counter offers to fill the order
   order is filled... > status done (done_reason = match)

case 2: current offers do not fill the market order
   What should happen?
        // FlyptoX implements this option //
        option 1.  accept doing a partial fill
                set order status done (done_reason = market_exhausted)

        option 2.  do not execute the order at all

        option 3. Do partial fill, (queue market order for processing again,
             when more limit counter offers come in)
              this would mean we have to update our logic
              on incoming limit order, try and fill market orders in queue first

        option 4. turn it into limit order ?
